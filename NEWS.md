# bipsdown 0.2.0

## Changes for xaringan theme

- Increase default font size from 20px to 25px for better readability
- Slightly decrease the code font size from 0.9rem to 0.8rem
- Show slide number on `.inverse` slides with inverted text color (i.e. white)
- Allow hiding the slide number with `class: unnumbered`
- Allow hiding the logo with `class: nologo` (Note that this sets `background-image: none`, so if you want to show a background image, the logo is hidden anyway)
- Also add dividing line under `h2` elements (e.g. `## My Level 2 Heading`) as was done for `h1`
